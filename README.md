Mystery Language Project:  Mbarrumbathama (Lamalama)

## Introduction:
In this project I explore the language variety Mbarrumbathama. I do this by first analyzing Verstraete’s 
(2019) corpus on my own for consonants, vowels, and stress. I then compare my findings to Verstraete’s 
(2019), which I consider as the correct analyzation.

Mbarrumbathama is a variety of Lamalama. The other best-known variety of Lamalama is 
Mbarrukarruw. They are spoken in the Cape York Peninsula, Queensland State, Australia (Verstraete, 
2019). According the 2016 census, Lamalama is spoken by three people, and it is nearly extinct 
(Eberhard, 2021).

This language was spoken by about 20 clans with many of their own varieties. In fact, the name for each 
variety is named after each clan. Most of the dialectal variation varies in the lexical terms and 
phonological differences between clans. However, there is not enough documentation to see how the 
dialects exactly differ by clan (Verstraete, 2019).

There does not seem to be much effort in trying to revitalize the language, as least in terms of the 
actions being documented online. However, there does seem to be great effort in preserving the 
traditional lands of the Lama Lama People. There is now a national park located there (Lama Lama 
People).

The Lamalama language’s three-letter ISO 639-3 code is lby. It comes from the language family 
Lamalamic. This language family comes from the Paman family, which comes from the Pama-Nyungan 
family. This is all under the Australian language family. The most closely related language is 
Morrobalama, which is also under the Lamalamic language family. However, there are no known L1 
speakers for this language and it is considered extinct (Eberhard, 2021).

The recordings used to analyze the phonetics of language are represented by three speakers: Daisy Salt, 
Maudie Brown, and Daisy Stewart. Where possible, Daisy Salt’s recording is used as she “represents the 
oldest generation of speakers in [Verstraete’s] corpus” (Verstraete, 2019).
